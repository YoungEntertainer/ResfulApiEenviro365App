# EEnviro365 File Processing REST API
Welcome to the EEnviro365 File Processing REST API documentation. This API facilitates file data processing for environmental analysis. Clients can upload text files containing environmental data and retrieve processed results through simple API requests. This document provides an overview of the API, its endpoints, request and response formats, and error handling procedures.

# Scenario
EEnviro365 is a leading environmental consulting firm aiming to develop a RESTful API to streamline file data processing for their clients. The API will allow clients to upload text files containing environmental data for analysis and retrieve processed results via API requests, which will be saved in the database. As a software developer tasked with building this API, your goal is to design and implement a solution that meets the requirements outlined by Enviro365.

# Task
Build a Spring Boot application that exposes a REST API for clients.
Design REST API endpoints, specifying request and response formats for each endpoint.
Implement API endpoints using a Java framework such as Spring Boot.
Thoroughly test API endpoints to ensure functionality, reliability, and performance.
Document API endpoints, input parameters, response formats, and error handling procedures.
API Endpoints
# 1. File Upload Endpoint
URL: /api/upload
Method: POST
Description: Allows clients to upload text files containing environmental data.
Request Body: Multipart/form-data with the file to be uploaded.
Response:
HTTP Status 200 OK on successful upload.
HTTP Status 400 Bad Request if no file is provided.
HTTP Status 500 Internal Server Error if an error occurs during file upload.
# 2. Processed Results Retrieval Endpoint
URL: /api/results/{id}
Method: GET
Description: Retrieves processed results for a specific file ID.
Path Parameter:
{id}: ID of the uploaded file.
 Response:
HTTP Status 200 OK on successful retrieval with processed results.
HTTP Status 404 Not Found if the file ID does not exist.
HTTP Status 500 Internal Server Error if an error occurs during retrieval.

# Testing
Thoroughly test the API endpoints using tools like Postman to ensure functionality, reliability, and performance.

# Documentation
Comprehensive documentation should be maintained to describe each endpoint, input parameters, response formats, and error handling procedures. This documentation should be easily accessible to clients integrating with the API.

# Implementation
The API endpoints should be implemented using a Java framework such as Spring Boot. Ensure proper error handling, validation, and security measures are implemented to make the API robust and secure.
